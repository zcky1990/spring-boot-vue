# spring-boot-vuejs

## First App run

Inside the root directory, do a: 

```
mvn clean install
```

Run our complete Spring Boot App:

```
mvn --projects backend spring-boot:run
```

Now go to http://localhost:8088/ and have a look at your first Vue.js Spring Boot App.



## Faster feedback with webpack-dev-server

The webpack-dev-server, which will update and build every change through all the parts of the JavaScript build-chain, is pre-configured in Vue.js out-of-the-box! So the only thing needed to get fast feedback development-cycle is to cd into `frontend` and run:

```
npm run serve
```

Thatâ€™s it!
